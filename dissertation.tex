\begin{abstract}
The exotic collective excitation transverse wobbling has been investigated in the nucleus, \pr{}. A pair of zero and one phonon wobbling bands has been observed. The nature of these wobbling bands was confirmed by the $\Delta{}I=1, E2$ nature of the $n_w=1\rightarrow n_w=0$ interband transitions. Making \pr{} the first nucleus in the $A\sim{}135$ observed to exhibit wobbling behavior. Additionally, a possible two phonon wobbling band has been observed as well and its nature has been partially confirmed by measuring the $\Delta{}I=1, E2$ nature of the $n_w=2\rightarrow n_w=1$ interband transitions. The theory of transverse wobbling, proposed to explain contradictions in the wobbling energy predicted by previous quasiparticle plus triaxial rotor calculations, has been confirmed. In this model, the quasiparticle aligns with an axis perpendicular to the axis with maximal moment of inertia (in contrast to previous theories, which aligned the quasiparticle with the axis with maximum moment of inertia). With this modification the fall in the energy of the wobbling phonon, observed in experiment, is now correctly predicted by theory. This confirmation of theory suggests a reevaluation of the previously discovered wobbling nuclei in the $A\sim{}170$ region in the framework of transverse wobbling as well.

\begin{acknowledge}
In the long and difficult period I have been a student at Notre Dame many individuals have contributed, giving their time, scientific guidance, and emotional support, without them I would have failed in this task and I will remain forever indebted to them. I would like to thank every contributor to this work, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Foremost, I would like to offer my most profound thanks to Dr. Umesh Garg, my research advisor here at Notre Dame. I am deeply grateful for his introducing me to the world of nuclear physics. Without his guidance, none of this would have been possible. Without his patience, I would not have succeeded. His push to constantly improve my analysis and test \emph{why} something happens rather than simply accept it has had a major impact on me and my way of thinking. Without his patience, comments, and advice, this manuscript would be much poorer. I will never forget his help, nor will I ever cease to be thankful for it.

I would like to thank my committee, past and present, for their assistance and advice. To Dr. James Kolata and Dr. Collin Jessop, I would like to apologize for the scheduling problems that prevented your participation in the defense, for steering my research and giving good advice on jobs after graduation I will be eternally grateful. To Dr. Stefan Frauendorf, for assisting my research so much in helping me understand the theory behind it, I will never cease to be in your debt. To Dr. Anna Simon and Dr. Bruce Bunker, without your willingness to become members of my committee on short notice, I would never have been able to complete this effort, you have my deepest thanks and eternal gratitude.

I would like to extend thanks to Ms. Weichaun Li, Dr. Friedrich D\"onau, and Dr. Stefan Frauendorf. Without their excellent theoretical work, a nice interpretation and understanding of the data would not be possible.

To Dr. Rajarshi Raut I extend my humblest thanks. His patience with my many questions was deeply appreciated. Even more appreciated was his guidance in a land that was strange to me.

I would like to thank Dr. Robert V.F. Janssens, without his assistance, guidance, and patience with my early mistakes at conferences, I would lost.

What skills I have learned in the analysis and interpretation of $\gamma{}$-ray coincidence data I owe to Dr. Somsundar Mukhopadhyay, Dr. Shaofei Zhu, Dr. Xiaofeng Wang, and Dr. Daryl Hartley. The codes they provided and the skills they taught are a great boon to me, and I am thankful for their patience in passing them on.

I would like to deeply thank Dr. Akaa D. Ayangeakaa and Dr. Darshana Patel. They were my year-mates and friends while they were here. Without them, I would not have matured as much as I did, I would not have learned half as much as I did without our discussions, nor would my time at Notre Dame have been half as pleasant. I thank you both from the bottom of my heart.

I would like to thank the other scientists who collaborated on the work presented in this dissertation Dr. Rudrajyoti Palit, Dr. Sudipta Saha, Dr. Jasmine Sethi, Dr. Tarkeshwar Trivedi, Dr. Sandeep S Ghugre, Dr. Ajit K Sinha, Dr. Michael P. Carpenter, Dr. Torben Lauritsen, Dr. Darek Seweryniak, Dr. Filip Kondev, Dr. Christopher J. Chiara, Ms. D. Vijaya Lakshmi,  Dr. P.V. Madhusudhana Rao, Dr. M. Kumar Raju, Dr. Sujit Tandel, and Dr. Sudipta Ray. Without their support in sitting shifts and dealing with the data, I would have been lost.

I wish to thank the staff of the ATLAS facility and the TIFR-BARC Pelletron facility. Without their tireless troubleshooting and operation of the machines, this journey could not have started, let alone finished.

I would like to thank my parents Margaret and James. Without their anecdotes of their own time in graduate school, I would be much less sane. Without their tireless copy editing, this document would be much poorer than it is, rife with grammatical errors.

Finally, I would like to thank my fianc\'{e} Tina without her, love, understanding, and emotional support I would have fallen from this path long ago.
