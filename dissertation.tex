\begin{abstract}
The exotic collective excitation transverse wobbling has been investigated in the nucleus, \pr{}. A pair of zero and one-phonon wobbling bands has been observed. The nature of these wobbling bands was confirmed by the $\Delta{}I=1, E2$ nature of the $n_w=1\rightarrow n_w=0$ interband transitions making \pr{} the first nucleus observed to exhibit wobbling behavior other than five nuclei in the $A\sim{}160$. Additionally, a possible two-phonon wobbling band has been observed and its nature has been partially confirmed by measuring the $\Delta{}I=1, E2$ nature of the $n_w=2\rightarrow n_w=1$ interband transitions. The theory of transverse wobbling was proposed to explain contradictions in the wobbling energy predicted by previous quasiparticle plus triaxial rotor calculations; this theory has been confirmed. In this model, the quasiparticle aligns with an axis perpendicular to the axis with maximal moment of inertia (in contrast to previous theories, which aligned the quasiparticle with the axis with maximum moment of inertia). With this modification the fall in the energy of the wobbling phonon, observed in experiment, is now correctly predicted by theory. This confirmation of theory suggests a reevaluation of the previously discovered wobbling nuclei in the $A\sim{}160$ region in the framework of transverse wobbling as well.

\begin{acknowledge}
In the long and difficult period I have been a student at Notre Dame many individuals have assisted me, giving their time, scientific guidance, and emotional support, without them I would have failed in this task and I remain indebted to them. I would like to sincerely thank every contributor to this work; thank you.

Foremost, I would like to offer my most profound thanks to Dr. Umesh Garg, my research advisor here at Notre Dame. I am grateful for his introducing me to the world of nuclear physics. Without his guidance, none of this would have been possible. Without his understanding, I would not have succeeded. His push to constantly improve my analysis and test \emph{why} something happens rather than simply accept it has had a major impact on me and my way of thinking. Without his patience, comments, and advice, this manuscript would be much poorer. I am profoundly gratefule for his advice and assistance.

I would like to thank my committee, past and present, for their assistance and advice. To Dr. James Kolata and Dr. Collin Jessop, I would like to apologize for the scheduling problems that prevented your participation in the defense, and accept my sincere thanks for steering my research and giving good advice on post-doctorate positions. Dr. Stefan Frauendorf's assistance has been invaluable in helping me understand the theory behind this work; I remain in your debt. To Dr. Anna Simon and Dr. Bruce Bunker, your willingness to become members of my committee on short notice has enabled me to complete this effort. You have my deepest thanks and gratitude.

I would like to extend thanks to Ms. Weichaun Li, Dr. Friedrich D\"onau, and Dr. Stefan Frauendorf for their excellent theoretical work. It has made a more complete interpretation and understanding of the data possible.

To Dr. Rajarshi Raut I extend my humble thanks. His patience with my many questions was genuinely appreciated. Equally appreciated was his guidance in a land that was new and different to me.

I would like to thank Dr. Robert V.F. Janssens, without his assistance, guidance, and patience in early conferences, I would have been lost.

What skills I have learned in the analysis and interpretation of gamma-ray coincidence data, I owe to Dr. Somsundar Mukhopadhyay, Dr. Shaofei Zhu, Dr. Xiaofeng Wang, and Dr. Daryl Hartley. The codes they provided and the skills they taught are a great boon to me, and I am thankful for their patience in passing them on.

I would like to deeply thank Dr. Akaa D. Ayangeakaa and Dr. Darshana Patel. They were my year-mates and friends while here. Their counsel has assisted me in maturing and their scientific discussions have enlightened. Further, their camaraderie has made for pleasant times while at Notre Dame. I thank you both from the bottom of my heart.

I would like to thank the other scientists who collaborated on the work presented in this dissertation Dr. Rudrajyoti Palit, Dr. Sudipta Saha, Dr. Jasmine Sethi, Dr. Tarkeshwar Trivedi, Dr. Sandeep S Ghugre, Dr. Ajit K Sinha, Dr. Michael P. Carpenter, Dr. Torben Lauritsen, Dr. Darek Seweryniak, Dr. Filip Kondev, Dr. Christopher J. Chiara, Ms. D. Vijaya Lakshmi,  Dr. P.V. Madhusudhana Rao, Dr. M. Kumar Raju, Dr. Sujit Tandel, and Dr. Sudipta Ray. Without their support in sitting shifts and dealing with the data, this task would have been Herculean at best and impossible, more realistically.

I wish to thank the staff of the ATLAS facility and the TIFR-BARC Pelletron facility. Without their diligent troubleshooting and operation of the machines, this journey could not have started, let alone finished.

If in my haste, I have omitted anyone I offer my sincere apology. So many have been of assistance in this quest; I am profoundly moved by their generosity of spirit.

I would like to thank my parents Margaret and James. Without their anecdotes of their own time in graduate school, I would be much less sane. Without their copy editing, this document would be poorer, and rife with grammatical errors.

Last but most important, I would like to thank my fianc\'{e} Tina without her, love, understanding, and emotional support I would have fallen from this path long ago.
