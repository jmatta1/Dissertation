\begin{acknowledge}
In the long and difficult period I have been a student at Notre Dame many individuals have contributed, giving their time, scientific guidance, and emotional support, without them I would have failed in this task and I will remain forever indebted to them. I would like to thank every contributor to this work, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Foremost, I would like to offer my most profound thanks to Dr. Umesh Garg, my research advisor here at Notre Dame. I am profoundly grateful for his introducing me to the world of nuclear physics. Without his guidance, none of this would have been possible. Without his patience, I would not have succeeded in the end. His push to constantly improve my analysis and test \emph{why} something happens rather than simply accept it has had a major impact on me and my way of thinking. Without his comments and advice, this manuscript would be much poorer. I will never forget his help, nor will I ever cease to be thankful for it.

I would like to thank my committee, past and present, for their assistance and advice. To Dr. James Kolata and Dr. Collin Jessop, I would like to apologize for the scheduling problems that prevented your participation in the defense, for steering my research and giving good advice on jobs after graduation I will be eternally grateful. To Dr. Stefan Frauendorf, for assisting my research so much in helping me understand the theory behind it, I will never cease to be in your debt. To Dr. Anna Simon and Dr. Bruce Bunker, without your willingness to become members of my committee on short notice, I would never have been able to complete this effort, you have my deepest thanks and eternal gratitude.

I would like to extend thanks to Weichaun Li, Dr. Friedrich D\"onau, and Dr. Stefan Frauendorf. Without their excellent theoretical work, a nice interpretation and understanding of the data would not be possible.

What skills I have learned in the analysis and interpretation of $\gamma{}$-ray coincidence data I owe to Dr. Somsundar Mukhopadhyay, Dr. Shaofei Zhu, Dr. Xiaofeng Wang, and Dr. Daryl Hartley. The codes they provided and the skills they taught are a great boon to me, and I am thankful for their patience in passing them on.

I would like to thank the other scientists who collaborated on the work presented in this dissertation Drs. Rudrajyoti Palit, Sudipta Saha, and Jasmine Sethi of the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research. Dr. Tarkeshwar Trivedi of Guru Ghasidas University, Bilāspur, Drs. Sandeep S Ghugre and Ajit K Sinha of the UGC DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, Kolkata Center, Drs. Michael P. Carpenter, Torben Lauritsen, Darek Seweryniak, and Filip Kondev of Argonne National Laboratory, Dr. Christopher J. Chiara of Argonne National Laboratory and University of Maryland, Drs. Vijaya Lakshmi, and P.V. Madhusudhana Rao, Dr. M. Kumar Raju of iThemba Labs, Dr. Sujit Tandel of University of Massachusetts Lowell, and S. Ray.
