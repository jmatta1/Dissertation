\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL METHODS}
\label{chp:exp-pr}
Across all of experimental physics there is a common theme in the design of an experiment. Finding a way of producing the system to be studied is one part of this theme. The other part is having the equipment to collect the signals necessary to understand what the system is doing. In nuclear physics, the appropriate choice of reaction will create the desired system and the equipment for signal collection will depend greatly on what one wishes to measure. This chapter will discuss the reaction, detectors, and techniques used in the examination of transverse wobbling in \pr{}.
\section{Heavy-ion Fusion-evaporation Reaction}
\label{sec:exp-pr-fus-evap}
Across nuclear physics there are vast array of reactions used. Narrowing to in-beam \gr{} spectroscopy one finds some common ``workhorse'' reactions that are commonly used. Of these workhorse reactions the heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reaction is frequently chosen for its selectivity in final products, producing relatively few species with large cross-section, and its creation of states with a large amount of angular momentum.\cite{beausang1996arrays}.
\subsection{Creation and Decay of the Compound Nucleus}
\label{ssec:exp-pr-fus-evap-cn}
The fusion evaporation reaction proceeds by the formation of a highly excited compound nucleus, a mechanism first proposed by Neils Bohr\cite{bohr1936neutron}. While it is possible for a compound nucleus to be formed for beam energies below the coulomb barrier the probability is dramatically lower as the beam must quantum mechanically tunnel through same barrier. Therefor for heavy ion fusion to be experimentally feasible the center of momentum energy must exceed the height of the coulomb barrier. The coulomb barrier height can be estimated with

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cb_en}
E_{CB}=\frac{\alpha \hbar c Z_p Z_t}{1.16 fm (A_p^{1/3} + A_t^{1/3} + 2)}
\end{equation}

and the non-relativistic limit the center of momentum energy is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cmf_en}
E_{cm} = \frac{\mu}{A_{t}}E_{p}
\end{equation}

Here the subscripts $p$ and $t$ denote projectile and target respectively, $A$ is the mass number, $Z$ represents the nuclear charge, $\alpha{}$ is the fine structure constant, and $\mu = A_{p}A_{t}/(A_{p}+A_{t})$ is the system's reduced mass. After its formation the compound nucleus will have an excitation energy of

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cn_ex}
E_{ex} = Q + E_{cm}
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is the reaction's $Q$-value which is,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cn_form_qvalue}
Q = (M_t+M_p-M_{CN})c^2
\end{equation}

The compound nucleus will also carry an angular momentum ranging between $0 \hbar$ and $l_{max} \hbar$, corresponding to head on and peripheral collisions respectively. A non-relativistic approximation of $l_{max}$ is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cn_lmax}
l_{max} = \frac{\sqrt{2\mu(E_{cm}-E_{CB})}R}{\hbar}
\end{equation}

where R is the 
, followed by either fissioning of the compound nucleus, or the evaporation of particles, finally leaving behind the excited residual nucleus. In the particle evaporation process each particle must penetrate a barrier, for neutrons this barrier is merely the centrifugal barrier while charged particles see the coulomb barrier added on top of that, this makes neutron emission more probable. Each successive evaporated particle carries energy away from the nucleus until there is insufficient excitation energy for particles to penetrate the emission barrier and the nucleus is left in a state that is stable against particle emission. From this point on the nucleus must dissipate its excess angular momentum and excitation energy via \gr{} emission. A schematic of a (HI, $p3n\gamma{}$) reaction is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:chp3-fus-evap-schem}.

\section{Gamma-ray Spectroscopy}
\label{sec:exp-pr-gamma-spec}
\subsection{Gamma-ray Interaction with Matter}
\label{ssec:exp-pr-gamma-spec-interactions}
As mentioned earlier, the choice of equipment will vary with which signals you need to collect to understand the system. In the case of a residual nucleus at high spin one of the obvious signal choices is the \gr{}s it emits. Detection of gamma-rays is dependent on the \gr{} depositting energy in a detector which in turn depends on the interactions of electromagnetic radiation with matter. At the energies relevant to nuclear physics, $10keV<E_{\gamma}<15MeV$, there are three primary processes to be considered, photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production. These three processes compete with each dominating in a different energy range.

\begin{figure}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[height=0.65\textheight]{./img/c3/gamma_interactions_scan.eps}}
	\caption{Gamma-ray attenuation coefficients for various processes in NaI, adapted from Ref. \cite{knollBook}. Here we can see the dominance of photoelectric absorption at lower energies, Compton scattering at intermediate energies and pair production at high energies. While the slopes of these processes changes from material to material the trends remain the same.}
	\label{fig:chp3-gamma-interactions}
\end{figure}

In photoelectric absorption the photon interacts with a bound electron in the detector material and is fully absorbed\cite{einstein-PE}. The total energy of the photon is then used to overcome the binding energy of the electron and to provide the electron with kinetic energy, giving $E_{e^-}=E_{\gamma}-E_b$. The electron then proceeds to lose energy as it passes through the detector material. In \gr{} spectra the full energy peak corresponds to the deposition of the photon's full energy in the detector medium. For that to occur either the primary photon, or all the secondary photons (generated by the processes below), must undergo photoelectric absorption. As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:chp3-gamma-interactions} the photoelectric effect is dominant at low energies and the energy at which the photoelectric effect ceases to dominate increases with the Z of the material.

In Compton scattering, a \gr{} photon scatters from an electron in the material at some angle $\theta$ to its original direction\cite{Compton-PhysRev.21.483}. Due to conservation of momentum and energy, the energy transferred to the electron is precisely determined by $\theta$ and so the energy of the secondary photon can be written as: $E_{s}=E_{p}(1+\frac{E_{p}}{m_{e}c^2}(1-Cos\theta))^{-1}$ As above the electron then deposits its kinetic energy in the medium as it slows. However, unlike in the photoelectric effect, not all of the energy is deposited in the electron. After the scattering the secondary photon travels in its new direction and is free to interact again with probabilities dictated by its energy. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:chp3-gamma-interactions} Compton scattering is the dominant effect at intermediate energies.

The final process to be considered is pair production. In pair production the photon enters the region of very strong electric field near the nucleus and its energy is converted into the mass and kinetic energy of an electron positron pair \cite{anderson-PhysRev.43.491,oppenheimer_PhysRev.44.53.2}. Since energy is conserved the photon must have energy of at least twice the rest mass of the electron, giving a threshold of $E_{\gamma}\geq1.022MeV$ for this interaction, any energy above this threshold is converted into kinetic energy shared between the two particles. After their production the electron and positron will both travel through the detector medium loosing energy as they travel. Once at rest the positron will annihilate with an electron, emitting two anti-parallel $511keV$ secondary photons. Fig. \ref{fig:chp3-gamma-interactions} shows the dominance of this interaction at high gamma energies, the energy at which pair production supersedes Compton scattering decreases with increasing Z of the material.

\subsection{High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detectors}
\label{ssec:exp-pr-gamma-spec-hpge}
In detecting gamma-rays there are essentially 3 major classes of detector, scintillator, gas, and semiconductor detectors. In all cases the \gr{} enters the active volume of the detector and deposits energy by at least one of the processes mentioned above, the primary energetic electrons, produced directly by the interactions of the \gr{}, then proceed to ionize or excite other electrons in the material, the secondary electrons are then detected in some manner. In scintillators they cause UV or visible light to be emitted and that is collected via photomultiplier or similar to produce a voltage pulse. In gas and semiconductor detectors the charge of the secondary electrons (and their corresponding ions or holes) is collected directly, albeit via different mechanisms, to produce the voltage pulse.

It is desirable that \gr{} detectors have both good detection efficiency and energy resolution. Unfortunately, in the \gr{} detectors presently available there is a conflict between these goals and so one must decide which parameter is more important. For high spin experiments where the spectrum is dense with peaks the energy resolution is the top priority as broad peaks would be indistinguishable from each other. Amongst the available detectors semiconductor detectors, particularly High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors offer the best energy resolution.
