\chapter{NUCLEAR MODELS FOR HIGH SPIN PHENOMENA}
\label{chp:models}
The atomic nucleus, discovered in $1911$ by Ernest Rutherford\cite{rutherfordNuclearModel}, is a tiny point of matter at the heart of an atom. This point of matter, is approximately $1-10fm$ across, contains more than $99.94\%$ of an atom's mass, and is composed of protons and neutrons. Since its discovery the nucleus has been studied and characterized using ever more sophisticated models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:models-into}

Examination of the two proton and two neutron separation energies (Fig \ref{fig:chp2-masses}) shows several distinct discontinuities at specific numbers of protons and neutrons.. Examination of the energies of the first $2^+$ (Fig \ref{fig:chp2-two-plus-energies}) states show peaks at the same numbers of protons. These ``Magic Numbers'' occur at numbers of protons and neutrons where there is a dramatic increase in the nucleus' stability. By analogy to atomic theory these magic numbers are construed to be closures of major shells. From this we conclude that the nucleus has shell structure which leads to the shell model of the nucleus.
