\chapter{TRANSVERSE WOBBLING IN $^{135}$Pr}
\label{chp:trw}
%As stated in chapter \ref{chp:intro} wobbling is the longest anticipated fingerprint of triaxiality. Bohr and Mottelson predicted its existence in 1969 in the first edition of the second volume of their book nuclear structure\cite{bohrMottelson2}. Despite this longstanding prediction of its existence, the first discovery of wobbling was in 2001 by \O{}deg\aa{}rd \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn163Lu}. Prior to this work wobbling had only been seen in five nuclei confined to the $A\sim{}170$ region, $^{161,163,165,167}$Lu \cite{wobblingIn163Lu,wobblingIn161Lu,wobblingIn165Lu,wobblingIn167Lu} and $^{167}$Ta \cite{wobblingIn167Ta}.

%Wobbling is the harmonic vibration of a nucleus's principal axis about its angular momentum vector. In the body fixed or intrinsic frame, wobbling is the harmonic vibration of the nucleus's angular momentum vector about one of its principal axes. In the simple wobbling mode, the principal axis used as a reference is the intermediate axis. This intermediate axis has the largest moment of inertia (MOI) and absent anything else is the preferred axis of rotation. In the transverse wobbling the reference principal axis is either the short or long axes as they are the axes that a quasiparticle with primarily particle nature or hole nature will couple to respectively. This coupling forces the rotation and wobbling motion to occur about these axes, eventually though the motion will become unstable and the wobbling will collapse as the rotation realigns itself to a new vector in the plane between the intermediate axis and the original axis of rotation. The final mode, longitudinal wobbling occurs when the Coriolis force aligns the quasiparticle to the intermediate axis. As in the simple wobbling case the rotation and wobbling occurs about the intermediate axis.
Understanding of the wobbling mode in nuclei has evolved quickly over the last 15 years. Bohr and Mottelson first showed that a rotating nucleus with stable triaxially deformed could have its rotational angular momentum precess and nutate about the principal axis of a nucleus (in analogy to the classical asymmetric top) \cite{bohrMottelson2} in 1975  they did so in terms of an even-even nucleus. 
The rash of wobbling discoveries in $^{161,163,165,167}$Lu from 2001 to 2005 \cite{propWobblingInLuTSDBands} \cite{wobblingIn163Lu,wobblingIn163LuTwoPhonon,wobblingIn165Lu,wobblingIn167Lu,wobblingIn161Lu} prompted a wave of theoretical analysis and questions about why this mode was not being seen in nuclei other than Lu isotopes. The discovery


\section{Previous Cases of Wobbling}
\label{sec:trw-prev}
One phonon wobbling was first observed in 2001 in the nucleus $^{163}$Lu by S.W. \O{}deg\aa{}rd \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn163Lu}. In 2002 two phonon wobbling was observed in the same nucleus by D.R. Jensen \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn163LuTwoPhonon} (partial level scheme pictured in the left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:chp4-first-wobb}). In 2003 one and two phonon wobbling was discovered in $^{165}$Lu by G. Sch\"onwa\ss{}er \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn165Lu} (partial level scheme pictured in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:chp4-first-wobb}). Later that same year came the discovery of one phonon wobbling in $^{167}$Lu by H. Amro \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn167Lu} (partial level scheme pictured in the left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:chp4-second-wobb}). 2005 was the year of the discovery of one phonon wobbling  $^{161}$Lu by P. Bringel \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn161Lu} (partial level scheme pictured in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:chp4-second-wobb}). The last of the previously known wobblers, $^{167}$Ta, was discovered in 2009 by D.J. Hartley \emph{et al.} \cite{wobblingIn167Ta} (partial level scheme pictured in Fig. \ref{fig:chp4-last-wobb}).
